  "readme": "Fast Source Map Concatenation\n-----------------------------\n\nThis library lets you concatenate files (with or without their own\npre-generated sourcemaps), and get a single output file along with a\nsourcemap.\n\nIt was written for use in ember-cli via broccoli-sourcemap-concat.\n\nsource-map dependency\n---------------------\n\nWe depend on mozilla's source-map library, but only to use their\nbase64-vlq implementation, which is in turn based on the version in\nthe Closure Compiler. \n\nWe can concatenate much faster than source-map because we are\nspecifically optimized for line-by-line concatenation.\n",
